**If you want to become a better 2-D game artist, this training is for you**. It will teach you how to work with Krita, a mature open source digital painting program. In 6 chapters, we will explore the most important features krita has to offer to game artists. Cherry on the cake: the tutorials are completely free!

If you're an illustrator or a concept artist, don't leave just yet! There is a lot for you to learn in here as well.

This course was made possible thanks to the pledges of 424 backers on Kickstarter.
