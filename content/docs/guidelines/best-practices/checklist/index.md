Use this checklist to ensure you didn't forget any key point in your Godot code and writing.

## Code style

- [ ] Functions names use verbs.
- [ ] Variable names use nouns.
- [ ] Variable and function names don't use abbreviated words.
- [ ] Boolean variables start with a prefix like is, has, or similar.
- [ ] Scene file names match the scene's root node's name.
- [ ] Script file names match corresponding scene names.
- [ ] I ran the [GDScript code formatter](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit) on all modified files.

## Writing

- [ ] I wrote an outline and submitted it for peer review.
- [ ] I ran my writing through a spell checker (Spell Right is a good extension for Code).
- [ ] I ran my writing through a prose linter like [writegood](https://github.com/btford/write-good) (available as a Code extension). [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) is an alternative.
  - [ ] There are few occurrences of passive voice in the t4ext.
  - [ ] There are no very long sentences.
