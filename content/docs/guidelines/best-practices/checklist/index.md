- Use this checklist as a guide to make sure you're not forgetting anything at every stage of your project.
- It is best referred to as you work along rather than at the very end.
- Depending on the editor you use, you can download an extension like [ToDo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) to display the checklist in the sidebar.

## 1. Scoping the project and getting a prototype review

- [ ] I singled out one real problem users have
- [ ] In case I'm writing for advanced users:
  - [ ] I discussed the topic with users in the target audience
  - [ ] I only touched on topics I'm very comfortable with
  - [ ] I got in touch with experts/core developers
- [ ] I wrote the tutorial header:
  - [ ] I made a bullet list with key information (title, pitch, audience, and teaching points)
  - [ ] I wrote the tutorial title
  - [ ] I listed the things the user will learn
  - [ ] I listed the prerequisites
  - [ ] I wrote a short introduction
- [ ] I created a prototype for the code demo using geometric shapes
- [ ] I created a pull request to submit it for review
  - [ ] I included the tutorial header in a PR comment
- [ ] I got confirmation from peers and members of my target audience on the scope of the tutorial and demo
- [ ] I agreed on review milestones if the code will take more than 2 days of work

## 2. Finalizing the code demo and getting a final review

- [ ] I defined the limits of my code instructions
  - [ ] I grouped all irrelevant but required assets, scenes, and scripts
  - [ ] I created an API to contain all relevant scripts: properties, methods' signatures, docstrings
- [ ] I kept my code as simple and readable as possible
  - [ ] I did not future-proof
  - [ ] I picked one valid solution
  - [ ] I favored inline code in functions (over splitting code across many functions)
  - [ ] I avoided popular principles that don't create a concrete benefit
  - [ ] I know why I chose every line of code over an alternative
- [ ] I followed the GDScript code order
  1. class docstrings
  2. class_name
  3. extends
  4. signals
  5. enums
  6. constants
  7. exported variables
  8. public variables
  9. private variables
  10. onready variables
  11. optional built-in virtual \_init method
  12. built-in virtual \_ready method
  13. remaining built-in virtual methods
  14. public methods
  15. private methods

- [ ] I followed the code style guidelines and syntax rules

  - [ ] Docstrings start with `##`
  - [ ] Signals are plain verbs in past tense and do not repeat class names
  - [ ] Signals take no parentheses if they do not pass function parameters
  - [ ] Signals corresponding to the beginning or end of an action are called `<action>_started` or `<action>_finished`
  - [ ] Function names are verbs
  - [ ] Variable names are nouns
  - [ ] Enum type names are in `PascalCase` and values are `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE`
  - [ ] Booleans start with `is_` , `can_` or `has_`
  - [ ] Public variable names are in `snake_case`
  - [ ] Pseudo-private variables names are in `_snake_case_with_leading_underscore`
  - [ ] Setters and getters are defined every time properties alter the objectâ€™s state
  - [ ] Docstrings are added for setters and getters if they modify the node/class state in a complex way
  - [ ] Setters and getters for a private variable start with a leading underscore
  - [ ] Onready variables are placed right before `_init` and/or `_ready` functions
  - [ ] Methods are separated by 2 blank lines
  - [ ] Signal callbacks use `_on_NodeName_signal_name`
  - [ ] `NodeName` is omitted when the object connects to itself
  - [ ] Variables have type hints and functions have the correct return type
  - [ ] Docstrings are added to public functions to describe what they do and what they return
  - [ ] Docstrings describing what a function returns start with `Returns`
  - [ ] Comments and docstrings use the present tense and active voice
  - [ ] Early `return` only occurs at the beginning of a function
  - [ ] Variable declarations use a colon `:` so Godot can infer type whenever possible
  - [ ] `null` references are avoided whenever possible
  - [ ] Variable names are simple and unabbreviated
  - [ ] Method names and arguments do not repeat the same word
  - [ ] Local variables inside a method can have short names

- [ ] I reviewed my code for readability and made sure it's self-explanatory
- [ ] I used comments whenever there is obscure code, calculations, or a strange bug workaround
- [ ] I ran [GDScript code formatter](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit) before pushing the code for review

- [ ] I named and organized files and directories according to our guidelines

  - [ ] I used `PascalCase` to name directories, scenes, and script files
  - [ ] I did not leave spaces in filenames
  - [ ] I named scripts and scenes after their root node
  - [ ] I grouped assets, scripts, and scenes together whenever possible
  - [ ] I placed files we may reuse across projects in Godot's addons directory (besides editor plug-ins)

- [ ] I submitted my code for final review and at every milestone if necessary
- [ ] I included the tutorial header in a comment in each pull request

## 3. Creating a tutorial outline

- [ ] I revised the tutorial header after the scope and code reviews
- [ ] I created logical sections for each main teaching point
- [ ] I wrote a descriptive heading and sub-headings for each section
  - [ ] I did not use new class names and technical titles
  - [ ] I did not use headings composed of one or two words
  - [ ] My headings capture the problem I'm trying to solve or the game mechanic I'm adding
- [ ] I filled each section heading with short notes and code snippets
- [ ] I focused on key teaching points and the order in which I'll teach them
- [ ] I wrote down questions the reader might have
- [ ] I worked with a peer to ensure I'm not forgetting anything

## 4. Writing the tutorial
