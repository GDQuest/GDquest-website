GDquest is a [Youtube channel][2d5e5423] about game creation.
It is also a growing community that regroups thousands of designers.
And a company that supports open source projects!

## Why GDquest?

There are lots of learning resources available online. There are lots of entertaining and informative videos about design, tons of speed painting with commentaries… But there aren’t many places where we can find carefully designed, free education for game creation and open source technologies.

That’s why I built Game Design Quest. I want to bring accessible, yet high quality learning resources to aspiring game designers. Game Design Quest is here to fill the gap, with a community focused mindset. Drawing inspiration from [CG Cookie](https://cgcookie.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), and Matt Kohr’s [CtrlPaint](http://www.ctrlpaint.com/), I produce resources that respects learners. I want to help people become more autonomous. To become better designers. All that following a simple, unalterable principle: **Quality over quantity**.

<blockquote>
You don't become a professional cook by following recipes. You're a cook the day you can come up with your own recipes. The same goes with design.
</blockquote>

On **GDquest**, you'll find:

  1. **Dozens** of [free game design tutorials][2]
  2. Many Open source game assets.
  3. [A lovely community][3] of game creation enthusiasts.

### I'm not alone!

I collaborate with talented people around the world in my free time. In particular, I work with 3 experienced professionals on a regular basis:

  1. **Arthur Shefer**, the author of the open source HTML5 game engine [Meta2d](http://meta2d.com/).
  2. **MagicFred**, a senior 2d game artist with a unique, cute art style.
  3. **Clément Brard**, a Unity developer and the author of [Lord of the Dungeon](http://lordofthedungeon.com/), a role playing game currently in development.

<h2>More about… me! <small>Wait, are you sure you wanna know more?</small></h2>

I’m a French game designer; self-taught for the most part. I studied character animation and music scoring online. I make art, educational videos, [soundtracks](https://soundcloud.com/gdquest)… I also code! Doing a bit of everything allows me to better collaborate with any teammate.

For as far as I can remember, I’ve always been interested in getting in touch with people. I’ve always loved to learn new techniques and to share them with others. I had no plans to do something like GDquest 2 years ago. My goal was to make games with the same mindset as That Game Company. But I got drawn to education very naturally, for the better! At the end of the day, I’m more interested in empowering others to create than to make games as products.

Aside from GDquest, I do Chinese boxing, I study Portuguese, Japanese and… ah! I write rap songs. [Yes, for real](https://soundcloud.com/gdquest/were-designers)!
