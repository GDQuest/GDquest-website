I will also provide you with an example to show you which tools I use the most, and how I've adapted my workflow to Krita.

description = "The broad steps to create any piece of art are pretty much always the same. We start by exploring possible designs, by sketching multiple thumbnails. Then, we pick one of our thumbnails and we move on to blocking foundations for our final piece. The next step is called refining, and mostly consists of turning our blocking into a good-looking piece of artwork. The last step is polishing. It's the most time-consuming one. At that point, we know that our artwork is already working well, so we can focus on improving its shading and adding all sorts of tiny details."
